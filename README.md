# FSWD-Project-4
This is the repo for the 4th project in the full-stack-web-development course

## Build System

In this project we are using `vite` in-order to create and run the app
it is a faster and better alternative to the `create-react-app` command

Run the following command after cloning the project:
- `cd fswd-4`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
